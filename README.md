## ⚠️ Considerations

- Ensure your `.env` file with API keys is not committed to version control
- The quality of generated content depends on:
  - The completeness of your resume
  - The quality of your existing cover letter templates
  - The specificity of the job description
- The chatbot can only answer questions based on information present in your indexed resume

## 🔒 Privacy

- All processing happens through API calls to OpenAI
- Your resume and cover letter data will be sent to OpenAI services
- Generated content and chat conversations are stored locally
- No data is retained on external servers beyond the API calls
