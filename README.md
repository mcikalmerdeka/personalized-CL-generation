## 🧩 How It Works

### Cover Letter Generation

1. **Document Processing**:
   - Loads your resume from PDF (uses full text - direct injection)
   - Optionally loads your portfolio from TXT (uses semantic search - RAG)
   - Analyzes cover letter examples for style reference

2. **Hybrid Context Assembly**:
   - **Resume**: Injected directly into context as full text for complete work history
   - **Portfolio**: Relevant projects retrieved via semantic search to match job requirements
   - This hybrid approach ensures complete resume coverage while highlighting most relevant projects

3. **Style Learning**:
   - Analyzes your existing cover letters for tone and format
   - Extracts structural elements and writing patterns

4. **Content Generation**:
   - Combines resume text with relevant portfolio projects based on job description
   - Generates tailored content using Claude Sonnet 4.6
   - References specific portfolio projects that demonstrate relevant experience
   - Maintains your personal writing style and format

5. **Document Creation**:
   - Formats content with professional styling
   - Outputs a ready-to-submit PDF or TXT document

### Employer Q&A Assistant

1. **Context Preparation**:
    - Resume text stored for direct injection (no RAG - complete context)
    - Portfolio indexed with semantic embeddings for RAG retrieval (when uploaded)
    - Job details saved separately to provide context

2. **Question Answering**:
    - Uses full resume text as primary context for complete information
    - Retrieves relevant portfolio projects via semantic search when applicable
    - Considers job context (company name, position) to tailor responses
    - Generates professional responses using Claude Sonnet 4.6
    - When job details are available, emphasizes fit for the specific role
    - Maintains conversation history for context-aware responses

3. **Interactive Chat**:
    - Real-time chat interface with employers/recruiters
    - Example questions to practice your responses
    - Easy conversation management (clear, save)

### Cold Message Generator

1. **Contact Information**:
    - Enter the contact person's name and position (e.g., HR Manager, Tech Lead)
    - The position helps tailor the message tone (formal for HR, technical for engineers)

2. **Message Generation**:
    - Uses full resume context combined with relevant portfolio projects
    - Creates a concise 150-200 word message highlighting your fit for the role
    - Automatically includes your resume, GitHub, and personal website links
    - Follows proven templates for AI Engineering and Data roles

3. **Professional Formatting**:
    - Generates a friendly yet professional greeting
    - Clearly states your interest in the position
    - Highlights 2-3 relevant skills that match the job requirements
    - Includes a clear call-to-action for next steps
    - Formatted for easy copy-paste into LinkedIn messages or emails

## ⚠️ Considerations

- Ensure your `.env` file with API keys is not committed to version control
- The quality of generated content depends on:
  - The completeness of your resume and portfolio
  - The quality of your existing cover letter templates
  - The specificity of the job description
- **Resume vs Portfolio Approach**:
  - Resume uses direct context injection (complete text) for accurate representation
  - Portfolio uses RAG (semantic search) to highlight most relevant projects
  - Without a portfolio, the system works with resume only
- Portfolio file should be a plain text (.txt) file with project descriptions

## 🔒 Privacy

- All processing happens through API calls to OpenAI
- Your resume and cover letter data will be sent to OpenAI services
- Generated content and chat conversations are stored locally
- No data is retained on external servers beyond the API calls
