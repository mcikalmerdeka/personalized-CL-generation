Hey [Contact Person], saw [Company Name] is hiring for [Position Name].

Noticed you're looking for someone with experience in [mention 1-2 key requirements from the job post].

I've also built dashboards in Looker Studio, Power BI, and Preset, and worked across dbt and Airflow for analytics engineering.

Already applied through the portal, but wanted to reach out directly in case it helps. Dropping my links here so you can have a closer look.
